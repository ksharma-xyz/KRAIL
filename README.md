KRAIL is a modern, Compose Multiplatform app providing a seamless trip-planning experience across
Android and iOS. Built using Kotlin and Swift (for minor iOS-specific parts), the app offers
real-time public transport information, personalised features like trip-saving and themes, and
modular architecture for maintainability.

## Architecture

KRAIL follows a modular, cleanly separated architecture to ensure clarity, scalability, and
maintainability across platforms. Key modules include:

- `composeApp`: Main entry point and UI code for Android and shared Compose UI components.
- `iosApp`: iOS-specific entry point and platform adaptations.
- `core`: Shared business logic (domain layer).
- `feature/...`: Feature-specific modules (e.g. trip planner, discover).
- `gtfs-static`: Handling GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) assets or prebuilt data.
- `taj`: Design system (Compose-based theming‚Äînot Material Design, but inspired by it).
- `sandook`: Local Database for offline storage.
- `core`: Core utilities and extensions e.g. appInfo, coroutines-ext, date-time, log, network.
