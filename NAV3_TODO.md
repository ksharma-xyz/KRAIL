1. When SearchStopScreen is open in Detail Pane, the selected stops are not updated in the SavedTripScreen (SearchStopSection)
2. Check When Date time is selected in the the detail pane, if the time is updated when nav back to timetable screen or not.
3. Should date time screen be instead a modal as service alert screen. (Will simplify nav logic / data passing.)
