### Architecture

This project follows MVVM [**Modern Android Development Architecture
**](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) with a focus on separation of concerns and
testability.

* **UI Layer:** Built using Jetpack Compose, providing a declarative and reactive approach to UI
  development.
* **Data Layer:** Utilizes repositories to abstract data sources and provide a clean API for
  accessing data.
* **Domain Layer:** Contains business logic and use cases, separated from UI and data concerns.
